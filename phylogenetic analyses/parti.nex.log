Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    cardenas (AVX2, FMA3, 15 GB RAM)
Command: D:\Graduate School\Trachy manuscript\GENOME_delimitation\IQ_tree\bin\iqtree.exe -s concatenated_samples.nex -o Myc_tur_571_CR071225_02 -spp parti.nex -m MF+MERGE
Seed:    807162 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Tue Oct 08 10:25:55 2019
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (12 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 12 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
